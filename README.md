## Introduction

VMF is a lightweight modeling framework for the Java platform. It generates/supports:

- deep and shallow cloning
- change notification
- undo/redo
- object graph traversal API via iterators and streams
- immutable types and read-only wrappers

VMF integrates well into manual Java implementations. It comes with a Gradle plugin which means that using VMF is very simple. The tutorials will walk you through all major aspects of VMF.
